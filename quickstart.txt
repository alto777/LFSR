The FG8 is a tone sequence generator.

It operates somewhat like a traditional sequencer, in fact out of the box it will basically function as such. Instead of only shifting an active channel along the stages, however, this sequencer provides multiple active stages.

As the clock shifts the contents:

1. In Fibonacci mode, the top bit is computed as the parity of the selected taps.

OR

2. In Galois mode, the shift register is broadside loaded according to the selected taps IF the bottom bit is 1.

Set or clear any bit in the register by clicking the red LEDs.

Select the tap bits by clicking the blue LEDs. Different taps will result in pseudo-random sequences of various lengths.

The gate select controls when gate signals are generated. If any shift register bit is ON and its corresponding gate control is on, a gate is generated.

The gate mode can be used to suppress output voltage changes in cases where no gate signal would be generated.

Lastly, the outputs are the sum of all active shift register stages. A single bit circulating (initial setting) just gives the row voltage just like a regular sequencer. If more 1s are shifting along, the active row pots contribute.

The row knobs are snappy and so constrained to even tempered output voltages. This means that the random sequences will also be.

This is just a sketch, as usual experimentation will reveal more. I'll try toâ€¦ improve this guide or do a demo or.
